# Time Tracker App


This is an app developed by me using React.js and Redux.js. It allows the user to time the tasks they're doing throughout the day along with categorizing them. I intend on adding a back end and expanding this app to include multiple days.

NOTE: Deployed at https://ardad2.github.io/Time-Tracker/.
